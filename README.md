# Data for Development: Asia

**Investigating data governance policies and practices in South and Southeast Asia.**

This project is undertaken by [LIRNEasia](https://lirneasia.net) and funded by [IDRC](https://idrc-cdri.ca). The repository contains the source code and text required to generate reports for seven focus countries—India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand—as well as a smaller report on data protection from South Korea.

## 📂 Project Structure

This project uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org). The files are organized to separate content (QMDs), metadata, and output files.

### Directory Layout

* **`_quarto.yml`**: Project-level configuration.

* **`d4dasia-bibliography.yaml`**: The master bibliography file (generated via Zotero/BetterBibTex).

* **`pdf/`**: The output directory where compiled PDF reports are saved.

* **`_extensions/lirneasia/`**: Custom Typst template adhering to LIRNEasia house style.

* **`country/`**: Contains sub-directories for each country report:

  * `in/` (India), `id/` (Indonesia), `np/` (Nepal), `pk/` (Pakistan), `sl/` (Sri Lanka), `th/` (Thailand), `kr/` (South Korea).

### Country Directory Format

Each country folder (e.g., `country/sl/`) follows this standard structure:

* **Report Source:** `d4dasia_country-report_{xx}.qmd` (where `{xx}` is the country code).

* **Metadata:** `_metadata.yml` (Country-specific settings).

* **Assets:** `images/` folder containing local diagrams and photos.

* **Local Bibliography:** `d4dasia-bib-{xx}.yaml` (Optional, only exists if country-specific citations are required).

### 📚 Bibliography Management

1\. Master Bibliography (d4dasia-bibliography.yaml)

The main citation data is stored in the root directory. This file is automatically generated by Zotero using the BetterBibTex add-on.

> **Warning:** Do not edit the master YAML file manually. Changes will be overwritten during the next Zotero export.

2\. Country-Specific Bibliographies

Some reports (e.g., Sri Lanka) require specialized citations not found in the master list. These are stored within the country directory as d4dasia-bib-{xx}.yaml.

* These are independent and do not interfere with the master file.

* They are linked via the country's `_metadata.yml` file.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites & Setup

To replicate this project, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Git**

* **[Quarto CLI](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)**

* **Visual Studio Code** (Recommended, with the Quarto Extension)

### 1. Clone the Repository

Bash

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Render the Reports

The project is configured to output files to the `pdf/` directory.

**To render the entire project:**

Bash

```
quarto render
```

**To render a specific country report (e.g., Sri Lanka):**

Bash

```
quarto render country/sl/d4dasia_country-report_sl.qmd
```

***

### Implementation Note for `_metadata.yml`

Since you mentioned Sri Lanka needs a specific bibliography _in addition_ to the main one, you need to ensure the `country/sl/_metadata.yml` merges both files rather than overwriting the main one.

Here is how you should format `country/sl/_metadata.yml` to include **both** the root bibliography and the local one:

YAML

```
# country/sl/_metadata.yml
bibliography: 
  - ../../d4dasia-bibliography.yaml # Refers back to root master bib
  - d4dasia-bib-sl.yaml             # Refers to local specific bib
```
