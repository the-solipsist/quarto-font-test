# Data for Development: Asia

**Investigating data governance policies and practices in South and Southeast Asia.**

This project is undertaken by [LIRNEasia](https://lirneasia.net "null") and funded by [IDRC](https://idrc-cdri.ca "null"). The repository contains the source code and text required to generate reports for seven focus countries—India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand—as well as a smaller report on data protection from South Korea.

## 📂 Project Structure

This project uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org "null"). The files are organized to separate content, logic, and outputs.

### Directory Layout

* **`_quarto.yml`**: Project-level configuration.

* **`d4dasia-bib.json`**: The master bibliography file (CSL JSON format).

* **`reports/`**: The output directory where compiled PDF reports are saved.

* **`_scripts/`**: Helper scripts for the build process.

* **`_extensions/lirneasia/`**:

  * Contains the Typst template and `brand.yml` for LIRNEasia house style.

  * `images/`: Shared logos and assets.

* **`country/`**: Source files for individual country reports.

  * `in/` (India), `id/` (Indonesia), `np/` (Nepal), `pk/` (Pakistan), `sl/` (Sri Lanka), `th/` (Thailand), `kr/` (South Korea).

### Country Directory Format

Each country folder (e.g., `country/sl/`) follows this standard structure:

* **Report Source:** `d4dasia_country-report_{xx}.qmd` (where `{xx}` is the country code).

* **Metadata:** `_metadata.yml` (Country-specific settings).

* **Assets:** `images/` folder containing local diagrams and photos.

* **Local Bibliography:** `d4dasia-bib-{xx}.json` (Optional, for country-specific citations).

## 📚 Bibliography Management

**1. Master Bibliography (`d4dasia-bib.json`)** The main citation data is stored in the root directory. This file is **automatically generated by Zotero** (using BetterBibTex CSL JSON export).

> **Warning:** Do not edit the master JSON file manually. Changes will be overwritten during the next Zotero export.

**2. Country-Specific Bibliographies** Some reports (e.g., Sri Lanka) require specialized citations not found in the master list. These are stored within the country directory (e.g., `country/sl/d4dasia-bib-sl.json`) and merged via the country's `_metadata.yml` file.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites & Setup

To replicate this project, ensure you have the following installed:

* [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/)

* [**Quarto**](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

* [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Recommended, with the [Quarto Extension](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/vscode/index.html).)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:the-solipsist/lirneasia-d4dasia.git
cd lirneasia-d4dasia
```

### 2. Render the Reports

The project is configured to output files to the `reports/` directory.

**To render the entire project:**

```bash
quarto render
```

**To render a specific country report (e.g., Sri Lanka):**

```bash
quarto render country/sl/d4dasia_country-report_sl.qmd
```

### 3. Organize Outputs (Optional)

To create symbolic links inside each country folder pointing to the generated PDFs in `reports/`, run the helper script:

```bash
./_scripts/link-pdfs.sh
```
