  {"id":"aryalEstablishingEffective2018","abstract":"Rapid developments of technology in Nepal over the last 10 years have made it very easy to use personal information or data for inappropriate uses. Moreover, the laissez-faire attitude of Nepalese governments to privacy issues has allowed the improper use of personal information to not only increase but also become flourish. Even though Nepal has witnessed massive and rapid enactment of laws and regulations and the law-makers did not pay enough attention to privacy and information protection issues. For example, both the right to privacy and the privacy protection legislation have been ignored until now. Although, after 2003, to the Criminal Law of the Draft Code and Electronic Transaction Act 2006 proposes to add a provision to protect privacy but did not apply the word privacy, the loopholes of this provision are still obvious. Both the legal subjects and the scope of the protection are not sufficient that some serious privacy problems still exist in Nepal. First, individual’s privacy is still placed at risk because the authorities and businesses have no standards to provide effective protection for personal information that they are keeping; second, authorities are able to exchange personal information freely without legal supervision; third, new information technology will continue to be introduced into Nepal; and so on. In consequence, the privacy interests of people have not been well protected so far and constitutional guarantee of Right to Privacy is not felt by the citizen.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Aryal","given":"Mahesh"}],"citation-key":"aryalEstablishingEffective2018","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.3193736","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,10]]},"language":"en","note":"0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2023-09-20]","number":"3193736","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"Social Science Research Network","title":"Establishing an Effective Privacy and Data Protection Law in Nepal","type":"article","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3193736"},

  {"id":"asherBigOpen2022","abstract":"The government generates terabytes of data directly and incidentally in the operation of public programs. For intrinsic and instrumental reasons, these data should be made open to the public. Intrinsically, a right to government data is implicit in the right to information. Instrumentally, open government data will improve policy, increase accountability, empower citizens, create new opportunities for private firms, and lead to development and economic growth. A series of case studies demonstrates these benefits in a range of other contexts. We next examine how government can maximize social benefit from government data. This entails opening administrative data as far upstream in the data pipeline as possible. Most administrative data can be minimally aggregated to protect privacy, while providing data with high geographic granularity. We assess the status quo of the Government of Indiaâ€™s data production and dissemination pipeline, and find that the greatest weakness lies in the last mile: making government data accessible to the public. This means more than posting it online; we describe a set of principles for lowering the access and use costs close to zero. Finally, we examine the use of government data to guide policy in the COVID-19 pandemic.

  {"id":"boydCriticalQuestions2012","abstract":"The era of Big Data has begun. Computer scientists, physicists, economists, mathematicians, political scientists, bio-informaticists, sociologists, and other scholars are clamoring for access to the massive quantities of information produced by and about people, things, and their interactions. Diverse groups argue about the potential benefits and costs of analyzing genetic sequences, social media interactions, health records, phone logs, government records, and other digital traces left by people. Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods? Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will data analytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or will it be used to track protesters and suppress speech? Will it transform how we study human communication and culture, or narrow the palette of research options and alter what ‘research’ means? Given the rise of Big Data as a socio-technical phenomenon, we argue that it is necessary to critically interrogate its assumptions and biases. In this article, we offer six provocations to spark conversations about the issues of Big Data: a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology, analysis, and mythology that provokes extensive utopian and dystopian rhetoric.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"boyd","given":"danah"},{"family":"Crawford","given":"Kate"}],"citation-key":"boydCriticalQuestions2012","container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","container-title-short":"Inf.

In Sri Lanka, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act of 2007 remains at the centre of this challenge. One of the principal aims of the Act is to protect persons from speech that incites violence and discrimination. This article explains how the ICCPR Act ought to be interpreted and applied. It then discusses how the Act is interpreted and applied in practice in Sri Lanka – how it has failed to fulfil its actual purpose, and has instead become a tool of repression. What is prohibited? Section 3(1) of the ICCPR Act provides: “No person shall…advocate national, racial, or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility, or violence.” This offence is not the only speech-related offence found in Sri Lanka’s law.

  {"id":"buttFreedomInformation2013","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              In 2008, Indonesia introduced its first “freedom of information” statute –\n              Law 14 of 2008 on Disclosure of Public Information\n              (the “\n              FOI Law\n              ” or the “\n              Law\n              ”) – which became fully operational in 2010. The\n              FOI Law\n              is an important component of the government transparency and accountability mechanisms established after Soeharto and his authoritarian “New Order” government fell in 1998. This article assesses the extent to which the\n              FOI Law\n              has been effective in requiring public bodies to disclose “public” information that they would rather keep within their ranks. More time is needed for these reforms to take hold. However, this article, which provides the first academic analysis of the freedom of information reforms “in practice”, shows that Indonesia’s central Information Commission and the courts have, with two important exceptions, applied the\n              FOI Law\n              in favour of information-seekers, thereby providing some reason for optimism for the future of this reform.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Butt","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"buttFreedomInformation2013","container-title":"Asian Journal of Comparative Law","container-title-short":"Asian J.

  {"id":"buttFreedomInformation2013a","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              In 2008, Indonesia introduced its first “freedom of information” statute –\n              Law 14 of 2008 on Disclosure of Public Information\n              (the “\n              FOI Law\n              ” or the “\n              Law\n              ”) – which became fully operational in 2010. The\n              FOI Law\n              is an important component of the government transparency and accountability mechanisms established after Soeharto and his authoritarian “New Order” government fell in 1998. This article assesses the extent to which the\n              FOI Law\n              has been effective in requiring public bodies to disclose “public” information that they would rather keep within their ranks. More time is needed for these reforms to take hold. However, this article, which provides the first academic analysis of the freedom of information reforms “in practice”, shows that Indonesia’s central Information Commission and the courts have, with two important exceptions, applied the\n              FOI Law\n              in favour of information-seekers, thereby providing some reason for optimism for the future of this reform.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Butt","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"buttFreedomInformation2013a","container-title":"Asian Journal of Comparative Law","container-title-short":"Asian J.

Current efforts to reconcile the two are likely to fail, and the result for globalization favors the largest international companies able to navigate the regulatory thicket. In a landmark finding, this Article shows that more than sixty countries outside the European Union are now evaluating whether foreign countries have privacy laws that are adequate to receive personal data. This core test for deciding on the permissibility of global data exchanges is currently applied in a nonuniform fashion with ominous results for the data flows that power trade today.\n\nThe promise of a global internet, with access for all, including companies from the Global South, is increasingly remote. This Article uncovers the forgotten and fateful history of the international regulation of privacy and trade that led to our current crisis and evaluates possible solutions to the current conflict. It proposes a Global Agreement on Privacy that would be enforced within the trade order, but with external data-privacy experts developing the treaty’s substantive norms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Chander","given":"Anupam"},{"family":"Schwartz","given":"Paul M."}],"citation-key":"chanderPrivacyTrade2023","container-title":"University of Chicago Law Review","container-title-short":"SSRN Journal","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.4038531","ISSN":"1556-5068","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","note":"3 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2023-11-28]","page":"49","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Privacy and/or Trade","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=4038531","volume":"90"},
  {"id":"chanyachatchawanDesignImplementation2023","abstract":"In the current era of extensive data usage across industries, data collection, preservation, utilization, and organization has become more challenging and nuanced because it is necessary to consider critical concerns such as data security, privacy, and legal issues, apart from efficiency issues. As a result, Thai government initiated the idea and effort to implement data governance throughout the government agency. This paper showcases the implementation of data governance in a governmental research organization with highly diverse structured and unstructured data. The implementation follows international standards and the guidelines of the Digital Government Development Agency (DGA). The executives set up the working body, including the Data Governance Council and Data Stewards, responsible for setting up and deploying policies and regulations. Creating awareness and the necessary infrastructure are the main focuses in the first-year phase. The metadata was designed to extend DGA's version and match the organization's unique requirements. A data catalog platform was developed accordingly. We organized activities to boost employee awareness and participation, including advertising and data catalog platform training. By the end of the first year of implementation, every organization unit had registered at least one data record into the data catalog.","author":[{"family":"Chanyachatchawan","given":"Sapa"},{"family":"Nasingkun","given":"Krich"},{"family":"Tumsangthong","given":"Patipat"},{"family":"Chata","given":"Porntiwa"},{"family":"Buranarach","given":"Marut"},{"family":"Socharoentum","given":"Monsak"}],"citation-key":"chanyachatchawanDesignImplementation2023","container-title":"2023 20th International Joint Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering (JCSSE)","container-title-short":"2023 20th Int.

  {"id":"dattaniGoverntrepreneurismGood2020","abstract":"In many of the ex-colonies of European empires, biometric technology systems are being built under an ethos of welfare and financial service delivery. One case in this broader trend of postcolonial governance is India's Aadhaar and India Stack. This paper uses this case to explore how the in-sourcing of technology into means of governing, behind a front of participatory “good governance,” is contributing to the historical trajectory of citizenship regimes in India. Through claims of reducing financial “leakages,” Aadhaar, a biometric identification database consisting of fingerprint, iris scan, and photograph, has become compulsory for accessing welfare in India. The Indian government makes a case for Aadhaar using a propaganda discourse of its success, based on weak evidence. The India Stack, a set of cloud-based application programming interfaces (APIs) built on top of the Aadhaar database, offers a digital infrastructure for private companies to verify identities using Aadhaar data and to offer other “services” including “financial services.” The ability to access data, paired with a “revolving door” of individuals between state and corporations, points to an ulterior goal of both Aadhaar and the India Stack: creating winners in the corporate and financial technology sectors. The Indian corporate-state run through a “governtrepreneurism” uses Aadhaar and the India Stack as new digital technologies of governmentality to transform populations into subjects or customers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Dattani","given":"Kavita"}],"citation-key":"dattaniGoverntrepreneurismGood2020","container-title":"Area","container-title-short":"Area","DOI":"10.1111/area.12579","ISSN":"1475-4762","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2019 The Author.

  {"id":"dattaniSpectrallyShapeshifting2024","abstract":"Through a hauntological frame, this article investigates how the ghosts of colonial pasts are re-emerging in India's national universal biometric identity system, Aadhaar, and a software infrastructure built on top of it, India Stack. It shows how Aadhaar and India Stack facilitate the extraction of data as a form of ‘data colonialism.’ Examining data colonialism through an enquiry of how the multifarious and unstable relations of colonialism are bound up with the extractive processes of digital data, the article uses a historical approach considering the shifting trajectories of identity ecologies in India to see what is dispossessed through Aadhaar and India Stack. In doing so it continues a trend in spectral writing – forcing an intervention between colonial pasts and presents. Detailing a specific chronology of events, the article reveals how ‘data relations’ have been co-produced by the Indian state and corporate fintech bodies over the last decade to coerce populations into a ‘digital financialisation.’ Using the metaphor of ‘structural-shape-shifting’, it shows how colonial relations continue within data relations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Dattani","given":"Kavita"}],"citation-key":"dattaniSpectrallyShapeshifting2024","container-title":"Journal of Cultural Economy","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"daviesGlobalDataBarometer2022","abstract":"Data is a source of power. It can be exploited for private gain, and used to limit freedom, or it can be deployed for the public good: as a resource for tackling social challenges, enabling collaboration, driving innovation and improving accountability. Over the last decade, data has risen to the top of national and global policy agendas: as nations seek to develop their economies, use data to address social challenges, and respond to citizen concerns about the uses and abuses of data. Yet, progress towards effective data governance, and to realising the public value of data, remains highly uneven across countries, regions and sectors. For example, while data protection laws are now widespread across the globe, many lack key redress mechanisms to allow individuals and communities to effectively exercise their data rights, and few comprehensively address emerging issues around location data, or algorithmic decision making. In critical areas like climate action, significant data gaps can frustrate local action to protect ecosystems, and respond to climate vulnerability. And when we look beyond the simple availability of datasets, to examine whether the data provided meets user needs, we find cases of data that's collected and shared, but that lacks key features or quality assurances that would allow it to properly power civic action, improved public services, and economic development. This first edition of the Global Data Barometer provides evidence and insight into the development of national and global data ecosystems: offering critical comparisons, analysis and examples that can help drive top-down and bottom-up action to realize the opportunities of the data revolution, while navigating its risks. In this sense, the Barometer aims not only to produce assessments of countries based on the state of their data, but also to assemble and support collective learning around what works, and about how to effectively intervene with and around data. In this report we summarize a number of key findings, and highlight how the data gathered through the Barometer can be used in further exploratory work.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Davies","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Fumega","given":"Silvana"}],"citation-key":"daviesGlobalDataBarometer2022","DOI":"10.5281/ZENODO.6488349","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International, Embargoed Access","publisher":"Zenodo","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Global Data Barometer","type":"report","URL":"https://zenodo.org/record/6488349","version":"First Edition"},

  {"id":"delaporteChallengesDigitisation2019","abstract":"Background: Digitisation of cultural heritage material creates both opportunities and challenges for access and preservation for future generations.\nObjectives: Digital cultural heritage can be sustainably preserved and used for information and research purposes if the challenges experienced during digitisation can be identified and addressed by memory institutions.\nMethod: A quantitative approach was used to analyse challenges for digitisation identified in the literature review. The theory of constraints was used as the theoretical framework for the study. Twenty-eight memory institutions in the City of Cape Town Metropolitan and Cape Winelands District municipalities were selected with non-probability sampling and data were collected with a cross-sectional survey, using a self-administered online questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the data.\nResults: The digitisation of cultural heritage material is embraced by memory institutions and a wide variety of cultural heritage material has been selected for digitisation. Memory institutions are following professional or international guidelines, but the lack of a national policy on digitisation has possible consequences for interoperability and limited access. Open access to digitised cultural heritage material is encouraged, but access for use is still limited. The challenges identified in the literature review are experienced by the memory institutions studied, especially those relating to expertise and human resources.\nConclusion: Challenges in digitisation can be addressed with the knowledge of how to manage these constraints. International guidelines and policies can give directives to the management of digitisation if no national or local guidelines exist.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"De La Porte","given":"Beatrice"},{"family":"Higgs","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"delaporteChallengesDigitisation2019","container-title":"SA Journal of Information Management","container-title-short":"SA Journal of Information Management","DOI":"10.4102/sajim.v21i1.1104","ISSN":"1560-683X, 2078-1865","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,30]]},"language":"en","note":"7 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2023-10-02]","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Challenges in digitisation of cultural heritage material in the Western Cape, South Africa","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sajim.co.za/index.php/SAJIM/article/view/1104","volume":"21"},

This disclosure can also be simultaneously deemed a lawful action under the Personal Data Protection Act B.E. 2562 (2019). However, this harmonization can only be achieved when a disclosing state agency strikes fair balance between transparency in the public sector and a right to privacy of individuals. This balancing activity can be conducted by analyzing and differentiating content of the information in question. Content of the information that appears necessary for public governance examination can be separated from the part that reveals identity of an individual. In addition, a state agency that is also a data controller under the Personal Data Protection Act B.E. 2562 (2019) owes a statutory duty to ensure security of personal data it possesses in accordance with Section 37(1) of the Personal Data Protection Act B.E. 2562 (2019). This implementation can contribute to a state agency’s responsibilities to prevent, handle, and mitigate risks associated with cyber threats.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Elamchamroonlarp","given":"Piti"}],"citation-key":"elamchamroonlarpApproachDisclosureOfficial2023","container-title":"Nitipat NIDA Law Journal","container-title-short":"Nitipat NIDA Law J.","ISSN":"2822-0609","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"th","license":"Copyright (c) 2023 วารสารกฎหมายนิติพัฒน์ นิด้า","number":"1","page":"66-83","source":"so04.tci-thaijo.org","title":"An Approach for Disclosure of Official Information containing Personal Data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://so04.tci-thaijo.org/index.php/nitipat/article/view/263675","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"fustermorellFrameworkAssessing2018","abstract":"The term “collaborative economy” or “collaborative economy platforms” refers to exchange, sharing, and collaboration in the consumption and production of capital and labor among distributed groups, supported by a digital platform. Collaborative economies’ use is growing rapidly and exponentially, creating high expectations of sustainability and their potential to contribute to the democratization of the economy. However, collaborative economy platforms lack a holistic framework to assess their sustainability and pro-democratization qualities. In addition, there is confusion about platforms which present themselves as collaborative when they actually are not, and similar uncertainties and ambiguities are associated with diverse models. To address this confusion, this article provides a framework for assessing the pro-democratic qualities of collaborative economy initiatives. It was applied to 10 cases in the context of the city of Barcelona. The methods used in this study include mapping and typifying 10 collaborative economy cases in the city, structured and in-depth interviews, and a co-creation session. The results indicate the presence of several modalities for favoring democratic values in a collaborative economy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Fuster Morell","given":"Mayo"},{"family":"Espelt","given":"Ricard"}],"citation-key":"fustermorellFrameworkAssessing2018","container-title":"Urban Science","container-title-short":"Urban Sci.","DOI":"10.3390/urbansci2030061","ISSN":"2413-8851","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"3","page":"61","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"A Framework for Assessing Democratic Qualities in Collaborative Economy Platforms: Analysis of 10 Cases in Barcelona","title-short":"A Framework for Assessing Democratic Qualities in Collaborative Economy Platforms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2413-8851/2/3/61","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"galDataStandardization2019","abstract":"With data rapidly becoming the lifeblood of the global economy, the efficiency of its use significantly affects both social and private welfare. While the volume of data collected has reached astronomical proportions, the fact that most data are collected in a system that is largely modular and distributed creates a “Tower of Babel” of different databases, thereby potentially limiting synergetic knowledge production. Data standardization is key to facilitating and improving the use of data. Indeed, standardization is a precondition for the operation of industries in which cross-firm and cross-industry data exchanges are critical. It can also create substantial benefits when data synergies carry high value. It does so by reducing the three main technological obstacles to data portability and interoperability: metadata uncertainties, data transfer obstacles, and missing data. Despite the importance of data standardization, the role of the government in such standardization is rarely examined. This article analyzes the justifications for and the limitations of data standardization in light of data’s special characteristics. We first review the relevant characteristics of data and data markets.  We discuss the three main technological obstacles to widening the use of data, based on interviews with data scientists. We then explain how data standardization affects these obstacles and analyze the benefits and costs of data standardization. As shown, data raises new considerations about the appropriate interventionist role for regulators, that are generally absent from debates about the standardization of other products, and adds a novel dimension to some of the traditional considerations raised in more typical cases. For example, on the plus side, data standardization can lead to smoother data flows, better machine learning, and easier policing in cases where rights are infringed or unjustified harms are created by data-fed algorithms. It might also help support a more competitive and distributed data collection ecosystem. At the same time, increasing the scale and scope of data analysis can create negative externalities in the form of better profiling, increased harms to privacy, and cybersecurity harms.  Repercussions for investment and innovation in data collection and analysis are also analyzed. Finally, we explore whether market-led standardization initiatives can be relied upon to increase welfare, and evaluate the role governmental-facilitated standardization should play, if at all. We show that the need for reviewing and possibly facilitating data standards can be especially strong where potential data synergies are cross-industry or inter-temporal. We also explore the appropriateness of different regulatory methods for achieving these tasks. While governmental facilitation of data standardization may be justified only in limited scenarios, the current situation in which data standardization is rarely considered carries a large price tag.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,17]]},"archive":"https://web.archive.org/web/20231117091452/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3326377","author":[{"family":"Gal","given":"Michal"},{"family":"Rubinfeld","given":"Daniel L."}],"citation-key":"galDataStandardization2019","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.3326377","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,1]]},"language":"en","note":"8 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2023-11-17]","number":"3326377","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"Social Science Research Network","title":"Data Standardization","type":"article","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3326377"},

  {"id":"gorianSingaporeCybersecurity2020","abstract":"National mechanisms of critical information infrastructure (CII) protection differ depending on the information assets, authorities’ powers, methods of regulation, etc. Singapore implements the state-driven approach for CII protection that is balanced and calibrated in order to harmonize the efficient powers of authorities with the burdens imposed on IT industry parties. Singapore’s Cybersecurity Act 2018 (CSA) establishes a solid and precise framework for the CII protection specifying three core aspects: constant cooperation of public authorities and private sector in envisaging a CII system; broad authorities for prevention, management and response to cybersecurity threats and incidents in Singapore, and compulsory licensing of cybersecurity services. It emphasizes compliance with promulgated codes of practice and expresses designation of CII and cybersecurity threats. The distinctive feature of the act is its significant reduction of the compliance burden on cybersecurity professionals and CII owners. As for the CII protection it’s important that computer systems in the supply chain supporting the operation of a CII (i.e. data centre owners and cloud services operators) will not be designated as CIIs. Thus the CSA illustrates the narrow approach of law makers in envisaging its jurisdiction – it implies just CII owners and not any network operators. Singapore is a first jurisdiction in South-East region that has developed its cybersecurity legislation to impose requirements on certain businesses to implement protections against cybersecurity risks into their computer systems.","author":[{"family":"Gorian","given":"E."}],"citation-key":"gorianSingaporeCybersecurity2020","collection-title":"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies","container-title":"Smart Technologies and Innovations in Design for Control of Technological Processes and Objects: Economy and Production","container-title-short":"Smart Technol.

Bangladesh, Afghanistan and the Maldives continue to be the states in the SAARC region where there are no significant developments.The scope of Sri Lanka’s Bill is comprehensive in that it covers both the public and private sectors, and appears to have extra-territorial effect in similar terms to the EU GDPR (but in fact is more limited).  Exceptions to the Bill seem broad, but are constrained in many ways.  It does require lawful grounds for processing to take place at all, and goes on to contain many obligations of controllers, and rights of data subjects that are based on GDPR provisions (sometimes ‘watered down’ versions).  Compulsory registration of controllers, required in a previous version of the Bill, has been removed, but appointment of DPOs may be required, as may data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) when constitution or other rights may be put at risk by processing. Many of the marquee rights of the GDPR are present in some form, including the ‘right to be forgotten’ and  protections against automated processing, but not data portability. Data localisation requirements apply in the public sector, and export restrictions apply to the private sector, with a ‘white list’ and other exceptions. A data protection authority (DPA) must be appointed, but its independence is not guaranteed. Enforcement powers allow a lot of different interventions by the DPA, but the maximum fines (US$55,000) are trivial compared with the previous draft, and compensation is not mentioned. The article considers factors relevant to EU ‘adequacy’ and Convention 108+ accession.Bhutan’s Information, Communications and Media Act of Bhutan 2018 gives the Kingdom a minimal data privacy law to increase its gross national happiness. Nepal enacted The Privacy Act 2018 but it is not a data privacy law because it does not include most of the set of basic principles shared by all such laws since 1980. However, there are many provisions in the Act to which private sector bodies operating in Nepal should pay careful attention in order to avoid prosecutions or compensation claims.  Finally, Pakistan’s November 2019 revised version of its e-commerce policy promises a data protection law, but it is not clear that it is referring to the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018 which was introduced to the legislature. That Bill only covers the private sector, and at best might meet most of the requirements of a ‘second generation’ law (based on the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive), but not the GDPR.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,18]]},"archive":"https://web.archive.org/web/20230918164858/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3549055","author":[{"family":"Greenleaf","given":"Graham"}],"citation-key":"greenleafAdvancesSouth2019","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,1]]},"language":"en","number":"3549055","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"Social Science Research Network","title":"Advances in South Asian data privacy laws: Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Nepal","title-short":"Advances in south asian data privacy laws","type":"article","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3549055"},

  {"id":"gulHybridDemocracyPakistan2023","abstract":"This research venture investigates the experiences of hybrid democracy during the reign of Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM). The study also aims to address the challenges faced by the PDM government’s hybrid democratic setup from 2022 to 2023, and its repercussions for the future of democracy in Pakistan. The historical process of democracy in Pakistan has frequently been the focus of discussions about its structure, dual nature, operation, and derailment for a variety of reasons. Understanding their experiences, difficulties, and prospects is a crucial component of this dissertation to comprehend the hybrid nature of the democratic system of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM). The nature of this study is descriptive. Data collected from primary and secondary sources are reviewed and analyzed using qualitative approach of research. The in-depth interviews from participants were also conducted that helped to address the core of this issue. The findings of this research show that the historical democratic mechanism in Pakistan has been very complex. The study shows that the hybrid nature of democracy in Pakistan during the PDM government has seen reasonable civil-military relations, and indirect military interventions that resulted in a host of challenges for the likely future of democracy in Pakistan. The findings of research also found various success, failures, and difficulties, and potentials of a hybrid democratic system in Pakistan under the PDM administration. In a nutshell, the findings also show that Pakistan's hybrid democracy under the PDM government was chaotic and authoritarian, leading to an economic crisis and restrictions on the right to dissent.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Gul","given":"Sajjad"},{"family":"Ali","given":"Habib"}],"citation-key":"gulHybridDemocracyPakistan2023","container-title":"Journal of Development and Social Sciences","container-title-short":"JDSS","DOI":"10.47205/jdss.2023(4-IV)10","ISSN":"27096254, 27096262","issue":"IV","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,31]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Hybrid Democracy in Pakistan: A Case Study of The PDM Government","title-short":"Hybrid Democracy in Pakistan","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ojs.jdss.org.pk/journal/article/view/772","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"gunatillekeLimitationsFundamental2023","abstract":"Sri Lanka’s Constitution authorises the state to limit certain fundamental freedoms on the grounds of specific public interests. This article examines how this constitutional limitation regime has become vulnerable to majoritarian influence. It uses a case study approach, supplemented by key informant interviews, to delve into Sri Lanka’s constitutional practice with respect to limitations on fundamental freedoms such as the freedom of religion or belief, and the freedom of expression. The article illustrates how organs of the Sri Lankan state have equated notions of ‘public interest’ with the majority community’s conceptions of ‘security’, ‘order’, ‘health’ and ‘morals’. It argues that this practice reflects a cleavage between the moral legitimacy and the legal claimability of fundamental freedoms of minorities and satirists in Sri Lanka. It concludes that legal regimes designed to guarantee fundamental freedoms offer very little protection to minorities when the underlying politics driving the application of law is majoritarian.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Gunatilleke","given":"Gehan"}],"citation-key":"gunatillekeLimitationsFundamental2023","container-title":"International Journal of Law in Context","container-title-short":"International Journal of Law in Context","DOI":"10.1017/S1744552323000113","ISSN":"1744-5523, 1744-5531","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9]]},"language":"en","note":"0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2023-11-21]","page":"334-351","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Limitations on fundamental freedoms in Sri Lanka: majoritarian influence of constitutional practice","title-short":"Limitations on fundamental freedoms in Sri Lanka","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S1744552323000113/type/journal_article","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"guptaAnalysisFOSS2022","abstract":"India has formulated several FOSS policies that focus on government adoption and development. Many of them lack enforceability or face implementation challenges that often depend on the specific public official implementing software projects. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of existing government efforts for FOSS adoption to examine design faults that reveal inconsistent use. The first part of this paper examines the policies made by the State of Kerala and then matches them against the implementation. This is done through a study of frameworks based on FOSS adoption within government, the efforts particularly in FOSS based education and the activities of the International Center for Free and Open Source Software (ICFOSS). The second part of this paper then examines the policies of the Union Government of India, through a study of the policies that have been under the Digital India programme. Even here, the lack of institutionalisation is evident from the lack of proper implementation and the sporadic FOSS based developments do not achieve their full potential. This paper aims to document, analyse and propose a more ambitious agenda for FOSS policies by governments to secure and fulfill the mandates of existing policies and even to look ahead towards the formulation of next generation frameworks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,13]]},"archive":"https://web.archive.org/web/20231113144105/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4146240","author":[{"family":"Gupta","given":"Apar"}],"citation-key":"guptaAnalysisFOSS2022","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.4146240","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,25]]},"language":"en","note":"0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2023-11-13]","number":"4146240","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"Social Science Research Network","title":"Analysis of FOSS Government Policies in India","type":"article","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=4146240"},

  {"id":"hayatPrivacyIslamQuran2007","abstract":"Islam gives great importance to the fundamental human right to privacy. This is evident from the some of the verses of the Holy Quran: ‘Do not spy on one another’ (49:12); ‘Do not enter any houses except your own homes unless you are sure of their occupants' consent’ (24:27). The Prophet has gone to the extent of instructing his followers that a man should not enter even his own house suddenly or surreptitiously. This article attempts to explore the extent of the sanctity given to the right to privacy by Islam and the kinds of privacy it recognizes. It will also explore the extent to which this right has been recognized in the laws of certain key Islamic Countries. The article includes a case study of Pakistan, an Islamic state that recognizes the Quran and Sunnah as sources of law. Under the Pakistani Constitution, there cannot be a law in violation of the injunctions of Islam. In fact, various laws have been declared to be in violation of the injunctions of Islam by the Federal Shariah Court. The Constitution of Pakistan, as well as the Pakistani law on Freedom of Information, recognizes the right to privacy. Despite this, the main objective of the draft Pakistani Data Protection Law is not to enshrine the principles of Islam, but to satisfy the requirements of European Union Directive 95/46, in particular Article 25 thereof, with the hope of ensuring that data will be allowed to flow freely between the European Union and Pakistan, thus making Pakistan an attractive market for outsourcing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Hayat","given":"Muhammad Aslam"}],"citation-key":"hayatPrivacyIslamQuran2007","container-title":"Information & Communications Technology Law","container-title-short":"Inf.

  {"id":"huftyInvestigatingPolicy2011","abstract":"Societies develop ways of making decisions regarding collective problems, thereby creating norms, rules, and institutions; this is what governance is about. In policy research, governance has become an important focus of attention; but debates show a lack of clarity at the conceptual level and a confusion between the use of the concept for prescriptive and analytical purposes. The present article is based on the hypothesis that using a clarified, non-normative governance perspective in policy research can contribute to an improved understanding of political processes, including formal and unrecognised ones, those embedded in larger and smaller social systems, as well as both vertical and horizontal political arrangements. The paper is the result of a collaborative engagement with the concept of governance within several networks, leading to the development of the Governance Analytical Framework (GAF). The GAF is a practical methodology for investigating governance processes, based on five analytical tools: problems, actors, social norms, processes, and nodal points. Besides describing the conceptual sources and analytical purpose of these five tools, the paper presents examples of how the GAF can be operationalised.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Hufty","given":"Marc"}],"citation-key":"huftyInvestigatingPolicy2011","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"en","number":"2019005","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"Social Science Research Network","title":"Investigating Policy Processes: The Governance Analytical Framework (GAF)","title-short":"Investigating Policy Processes","type":"article","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2019005"},

In the present report, the Special Rapporteur begins by identifying the problem of targeted surveillance seen from the obligations that human rights law imposes on States and the related responsibilities of companies. He then proposes a legal and policy framework for regulation, accountability and transparency within the private surveillance industry. He concludes with a call for tighter regulation of surveillance exports and restrictions on their use, as well as a call for an immediate moratorium on the global sale and transfer of the tools of the private surveillance industry until rigorous human rights safeguards are put in place to regulate such practices and guarantee that Governments and non-State actors use the tools in legitimate ways.","author":[{"family":"Kaye","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"kayeSurveillanceHuman2019","event-place":"Geneva","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,28]]},"number":"A/HRC/41/35","publisher":"UN Human Rights Council","publisher-place":"Geneva","title":"Surveillance and human rights: Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression","type":"report","URL":"https://undocs.org/A/HRC/41/35"},

  {"id":"kitchinCriticalData2014","abstract":"The growth of big data and the development of digital data infrastructures raises numerous questions about the nature of data, how they are being produced, organized, analyzed and employed, and how best to make sense of them and the work they do.  Critical data studies endeavours to answer such questions.  This paper sets out a vision for critical data studies, building on the initial provocations of Dalton and Thatcher (2014).  It is divided into three sections.  The first details the recent step change in the production and employment of data and how data and databases are being reconceptualised.  The second forwards the notion of a data assemblage that encompasses all of the technological, political, social and economic apparatuses and elements that constitutes and frames the generation, circulation and deployment of data.  Drawing on the ideas of Michel Foucault and Ian Hacking it is posited that one way to enact critical data studies is to chart and unpack data assemblages.  The third starts to unpack some the ways that data assemblages do work in the world with respect to dataveillance and the erosion of privacy, profiling and social sorting, anticipatory governance, and secondary uses and control creep.  The paper concludes by arguing for greater conceptual work and empirical research to underpin and flesh out critical data studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Kitchin","given":"Rob"},{"family":"Lauriault","given":"Tracey"}],"citation-key":"kitchinCriticalData2014","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",7,30]]},"language":"en","number":"2474112","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"Social Science Research Network","title":"Towards Critical Data Studies: Charting and Unpacking Data Assemblages and Their Work","title-short":"Towards Critical Data Studies","type":"article","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2474112"},

  {"id":"larueReportSpecial2011","abstract":"This report explores key trends and challenges to the right of all individuals to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds through the Internet. The Special Rapporteur underscores the unique and transformative nature of the Internet not only to enable individuals to exercise their right to freedom of opinion and expression, but also a range of other human rights, and to promote the progress of society as a whole. Chapter III of the report underlines the applicability of international human rights norms and standards on the right to freedom of opinion and expression to the Internet as a communication medium, and sets out the exceptional circumstances under which the dissemination of certain types of information may be restricted. Chapters IV and V address two dimensions of Internet access respectively: (a) access to content; and (b) access to the physical and technical infrastructure required to access the Internet in the first place. More specifically, chapter IV outlines some of the ways in which States are increasingly censoring information online, namely through: arbitrary blocking or filtering of content; criminalization of legitimate expression; imposition of intermediary liability; disconnecting users from Internet access, including on the basis of intellectual property rights law; cyberattacks; and inadequate protection of the right to privacy and data protection. Chapter V addresses the issue of universal access to the Internet. The Special Rapporteur intends to explore this topic further in his future report to the General Assembly. Chapter VI contains the Special Rapporteur’s conclusions and recommendations concerning the main subjects of the report.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"La Rue","given":"Frank"}],"citation-key":"larueReportSpecial2011","event-place":"Geneva","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",5,16]]},"language":"en","number":"A/HRC/17/27","publisher":"UN Human Rights Council","publisher-place":"Geneva","title":"Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Frank La Rue","type":"report","URL":"https://undocs.org/A/HRC/17/27"},

The report expands upon the last report submitted to the Council by the Special Rapporteur on key trends and challenges to the right of all individuals to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds through the Internet (A/HRC/17/27), and addresses the issue through two equally important dimensions of Internet access: access to online content (sect. III), and access to Internet connection (sect. IV). In section III, the Special Rapporteur outlines the types of expression that States are exceptionally required to prohibit under international law (III.A) and also discusses impermissible restrictions (III.B), given the ongoing debate regarding regulation of content on the Internet. The report also addresses the importance of digital literacy and training in information and communications technology skills for individuals to enable them to access online content in an effective and meaningful manner. While access to Internet connection is not yet recognized as a human right, the report focuses on the positive obligation of States to facilitate the enjoyment of the right to freedom of expression via the Internet, and outlines both challenges and positive initiatives to make the Internet available, accessible and affordable to all segments of society (sect. IV). The report concludes with recommendations to ensure full access to online content that is free of censorship and access to Internet connection, particularly for marginalized and disadvantaged groups.","author":[{"family":"La Rue","given":"Frank"}],"citation-key":"larueReportSpecial2011a","event-place":"Geneva","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",8,10]]},"number":"A/66/290","publisher":"UN Human Rights Council","publisher-place":"Geneva","title":"Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression","type":"report","URL":"https://undocs.org/A/66/290"},

The Special Rapporteur presents an overview of the phenomenon, the relevant international norms and standards, including distinctions between types of hate speech, and examples of domestic legislation that contravene international norms and standards. While noting the importance of clear laws that conform to international norms and principles to combat hate speech, the Special Rapporteur underscores the importance of non-legal measures to tackle the root causes of hatred and intolerance. The report concludes with a set of recommendations to combat hate speech effectively without unduly curtailing the right to freedom of opinion and expression.

  {"id":"millerRoleInstitutions2022","abstract":"Today’s online economy relies on exchanges of data for services. Online service providers collect personal data to earn revenue from targeted advertising. Many users of online services are concerned that their data might be used in ways contrary to their interests, interfering with their privacy. This research focuses on online data collection, processing, disclosure, and use by private companies, and it considers both costs and benefits. Privacy policy in the United States places too much emphasis on notice and consent, which raises transaction costs without doing enough to protect online users from the risks associated with disclosing personal data online. More stringent privacy regulation similar to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation would impose substantial costs on firms, making it harder for small firms to compete against dominant platforms, such as Google and Facebook. This paper argues for permissive privacy policy that does not discourage collection and processing of personal information for online advertising. A better approach is continued case-by-case FTC regulation combined with expanded legal liability of data controllers for data practices that subject a user to specific and significant harm or risk of harm. This approach could be combined with fiduciary responsibilities for firms that collect large amounts of personal information.","archive":"https://web.archive.org/web/20230419214947/https://www.mercatus.org/media/document/miller-researchpaper","author":[{"family":"Miller","given":"Tracy C."}],"citation-key":"millerRoleInstitutions2022","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,7]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"The Role of Institutions and Policy in Balancing Privacy and Information Sharing in the Digital Economy","type":"report","URL":"https://www.mercatus.org/media/document/miller-researchpaper"},

This complex framework, with nationalist undertones, also reinforces India’s reluctant stance toward negotiating digital trade rules at the multilateral level. However, the impact of this reticent approach on various stakeholders in both the domestic and the global digital economy remains unclear and under-evaluated. Further, India risks not only losing the opportunity to shape digital trade rules that facilitate the integration of developing countries but also facing geopolitical backlash from its trading partners, thereby hampering both its long-term political and economic interests. Indian policymakers must therefore better balance nationalist interests with the underlying realities of the digital economy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,28]]},"archive":"https://web.archive.org/web/20240628130329/https://academic.oup.com/book/55328/chapter/428798735","author":[{"family":"Mishra","given":"Neha"}],"citation-key":"mishraDataGovernance2023","container-title":"Data Sovereignty: From the Digital Silk Road to the Return of the State","DOI":"10.1093/oso/9780197582794.003.0011","editor":[{"family":"Chander","given":"Anupam"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Haochen"}],"ISBN":"978-0-19-758279-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,6]]},"page":"0","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Silverchair","title":"Data Governance and Digital Trade in India: Losing Sight of the Forest for the Trees?","title-short":"Data Governance and Digital Trade in India","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780197582794.003.0011"},

In a country like India, where a very large percentage of the population is disabled, elderly, illiterate, rural, having limited bandwidth, speaks only a vernacular language or uses alternative platforms like mobile phones, having accessible websites becomes all the more important to ensure that government information and services which are available online are accessible and usable by these groups.\n\nThis report summarises the key findings of a test conducted to measure the accessibility of 7800 websites of the Government of India and its affiliated agencies against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, which is the universally accepted standard for web accessibility. It uses a combination of automated and manual testing to derive key findings.

  {"id":"nijmanUrbanizationSocial2025","abstract":"A major social transformation is reshaping rural India. New processes of urbanization are marked by steep declines in agricultural jobs, the restructuring of local economies, changing livelihoods, and the emergence of new forms of permanent circular labor migration. Our research suggests that this transformation has important social ramifications for household dynamics and class structures. We conducted a comprehensive geospatial analysis across 600,000 villages to illuminate the extensive spatial patterns of this transformation. Additionally, we collected primary data from two case-study sites in Bihar and West Bengal. Our findings indicate trends toward smaller household sizes and increased complexity in extended family organization, shifting the roles of women within households, and either a continuation (and possibly deepening) of class disparities or an upending of existing class structures. These observations deviate markedly from what is postulated in conventional Western urban theory, and they may be relevant to the urbanizing experiences of other parts of the Global South. In India alone, this transformation is affecting the livelihoods and well-being of hundreds of millions of people.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Nijman","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Van Duijne","given":"Robbin Jan"},{"family":"Choithani","given":"Chetan"}],"citation-key":"nijmanUrbanizationSocial2025","container-title":"Urban Studies","container-title-short":"Urban Studies","DOI":"10.1177/00420980251364677","ISSN":"0042-0980, 1360-063X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,13]]},"language":"en","page":"00420980251364677","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Urbanization and social change in rural India","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00420980251364677"},

It proposes a set of questions and highlights promising policy approaches based on three policy tensions and objectives that characterise data governance policy making: balancing data openness and control while maximising trust; managing overlapping and potentially conflicting interests and regulations related to data governance; and incentivising investments in data and their effective re-use.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,16]]},"archive":"https://web.archive.org/web/20231116075530/https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/going-digital-guide-to-data-governance-policy-making_b70b653e-en","author":[{"literal":"OECD"}],"citation-key":"oecdIntroduction2022","container-title":"Going Digital Guide to Data Governance Policy Making","DOI":"10.1787/b70b653e-en","event-place":"Paris","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,14]]},"language":"en","publisher":"OECD","publisher-place":"Paris","source":"OECD iLibrary","title":"Introduction","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/going-digital-guide-to-data-governance-policy-making_b70b653e-en"},

  {"id":"panditMarginalisationReservation2005","abstract":"In this article the author applies the Rawlsian principles of justice, which lay down a theory of fair equality of opportunity, to examine the Indian reservation policy. Both, in principle, seek to mitigate the arbitrariness of birth and provide individuals with an 'equal start' in life. Although reservations seem justified from a theoretical angle, the historical politicisation of caste has led to the distortion of the policy from being one that seeks to promote equality to a policy that preserves social inequalities and hierarchies. This has been one of the major causes that have prevented the envisioned objectives of the reservation policy from being realised. The problem may, however, be overcome by replacing the purely caste based criterion with one that takes into account economic backwardness as well and by expanding the scope of affirmative action beyond reservation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Pandit","given":"Sameer"}],"citation-key":"panditMarginalisationReservation2005","container-title":"Socio-Legal Review","container-title-short":"SLR","DOI":"10.55496/JJWV9055","ISSN":"09735216","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",7]]},"language":"en","note":"1 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2024-06-21]","page":"40","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Marginalisation and Reservation in India: An Analysis in the Light of Rawlsian Theories of Justice and Equality","title-short":"Marginalisation and Reservation in India","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://repository.nls.ac.in/slr/vol1/iss1/4","volume":"1"},

A large part of this is enfolding in the field of digital public infrastructures as the ‘India Stack’ branded suite of technological solutions permeates through areas like digital identity, instant payments, digital commerce, and consent management.

Drawing upon India's performance on global ICT-related indices and the OECD's Good Practice Principles for Public Service Design and Delivery, the paper also examines how the country is faring in translating its visions of digital transformation into outcomes. It identifies reliance on coercive digital adoption strategies, lack of participative decision-making, and insufficient accountability safeguards as some of the fault lines in India's path to fair and equitable digital transformation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,5]]},"archive":"https://web.archive.org/web/20240306042633/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0267364924000141","author":[{"family":"Parsheera","given":"Smriti"}],"citation-key":"parsheeraStackNew2024","container-title":"Computer Law & Security Review","container-title-short":"Comput.

Successful e-government implementation and service delivery depend on how the underlying information present in government websites is made accessible and usable to every individual. This article investigates the accessibility and usability of e-government sites in India. Our sample consists of 65 Indian e-government websites. The analysis was carried out using automatic evaluation tools. The results of the accessibility tests highlight the existence of accessibility issues based on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (WCAG 1.0) and WCAG 2.0. Usability tests also reveal that e-government websites give low priority to such aspects during website design and development. Hence, there is a need to improve the overall accessibility and usability of Indian e-government websites in order to improve the quality and in turn the E-Government Development Index rank of India.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,15]]},"archive":"https://web.archive.org/web/20240815122338/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10209-019-00704-8","author":[{"family":"Paul","given":"Surjit"},{"family":"Das","given":"Saini"}],"citation-key":"paulAccessibilityUsability2020","container-title":"Univers.

  {"id":"paulosChallengesRegulatingHate2021","abstract":"Despite the fact that international human rights documents stipulate that everyone has the right to freedom of thought and expression, many nations nowadays have laws that restrict or ban some forms of social media expression, such as speech that provokes hatred and violence. Some free speech advocates prefer an open market of ideas where no expression is restricted thinking that the best answer to harmful speech is discussions that allow different ideas to challenge any speech freely. Other scholars, on the other hand, contend that regulating hate speech on social media is crucial for protecting minority populations from the damages that such speech can inflict. Hate speech poses a difficult question that blurs the lines of free expression. Thus, based on the theories that underpin freedom of expression, this piece of work strives to analyze the regulatory dilemma on hate speech on social media by exploring the arguments and challenges that frame the regulatory process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Paulos","given":"Biruk"},{"family":"Çeli̇K","given":"Seydi"}],"citation-key":"paulosChallengesRegulatingHate2021","container-title":"Süleyman Demirel Üniversitesi Hukuk Fakültesi Dergisi","container-title-short":"Süleyman Demirel Üniversitesi Hukuk Fakültesi Derg.","DOI":"10.52273/sduhfd..922588","ISSN":"2146-7129","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,30]]},"language":"en","page":"97-134","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The challenges of regulating hate speech on social media in light of the theory of freedom of expression","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dergipark.org.tr/en/doi/10.52273/sduhfd..922588","volume":"11"},

This study employed a qualitative research method by analyzing legal documents such as law textbooks, articles, theses, court judgments, and online data from both local and foreign sources. The study found that the Personal Data Protection Act B.E. 2562 provides uncovered and unclear provisions on the right to be forgotten by internet search engines. The study recommends promulgating the regulations for exercising rights and providing exemptions for the right to be forgotten by the internet search engines explicitly at the secondary law level as an appropriate guideline for protecting the right to be forgotten by the internet search engines in Thailand.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",7,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Plumkoson","given":"Paradee"},{"family":"Pibul","given":"Auntika Na"},{"family":"Vanaphituk","given":"Varaporn"}],"citation-key":"plumkosonProtectionRightBe2022","container-title":"Rajapark Journal","container-title-short":"Rajapark J.","ISSN":"3057-1324","issue":"45","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,5]]},"language":"th","license":"Copyright (c) 2022 วารสารรัชต์ภาคย์","number":"45","page":"336-352","source":"so05.tci-thaijo.org","title":"Protection of the Right to Be Forgotten on the Internet: The Study of Search Engine","title-short":"การคุ้มครองสิทธิในการถูกลืมบนระบบอินเทอร์เน็ต","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://so05.tci-thaijo.org/index.php/RJPJ/article/view/255766","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"prasetyoTrajectoryDemocracy2022","abstract":"COVID-19 pandemic has heavily influenced the legal conduct of a state, especially Sri Lanka. This country is one of the so-called democratic states shown to abuse law conduct under the backdrop of emergency measures, so many people have been detained due to newly enacted policies. Since the beginning of this pandemic, various criticism of pandemic management has addressed the state-triggered government overreaches such as arrestable offenses and internet censorship in the name of public order. This research aims to analyze whether the government's responses to opinions, critics, or any media format that embodies a form of speech are justified as an emergency measure against COVID-19. Then, this paper analyzes further its implication for freedom of speech. In addition, this research aims to challenge the government's measurement of the limitation of freedom of expression in social media. This research analyzes the government's response to securing fundamental rights during emergency regulations. In addition, the Sri Lankan legal framework of previous judicial precedent and state conduct towards the issue will be further analyzed. In addition, various rules from the authoritarian and democratic states compared further understand the framework on freedom of expression. This study showed a declining democratic value in Sri Lanka. Different legal conducts indicated that the Sri Lankan government does not comply with the rule of law and the fundamental rights of its citizen. This study emphasizes the need for immediate legal reform, especially in various mishandled cases. State oppression of freedom of expression harms the public order and threatens state stability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Prasetyo","given":"Anggi"},{"family":"Prabhata","given":"Evoryo Carel"}],"citation-key":"prasetyoTrajectoryDemocracy2022","container-title":"Jurnal Kajian Pembaruan Hukum","container-title-short":"J.

All in all, the Cybersecurity Law exhibits distinctive Chinese characteristics.

However, there are significant differences.  In the following sections we highlight some of the differences, based on an initial reading of the two documents. This is not an analysis of how either law will be interpreted and enforced (in the case of Sri Lanka) or is being interpreted and enforced (in the case of Singapore).

Social media plays a significant role in hate speech spreading online. Due to paralinguistic posts (e.g., emotions, hashtags) in social media, it is difficult to detect automatically in which it contains plenty of poorly written text. That provides automatic results for hate speech detection, several pieces of research were introduced ranges from simple to complex deep neural networks models. This paper proposes background detection of hate speech. Furthermore, anti-social behaviour topics and recent contributions of hate speech are reviewed. Finally, issues and recommendations of hate speech detections are explained in detail.","author":[{"family":"Shibly","given":"FHA"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Uzzal"},{"family":"Naleer","given":"HMM"}],"citation-key":"shiblySurveyMultilingual","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"A Survey on Multilingual Hate Speech Detection and Classification by Machine Learning Techniques","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"slemrodHowTaxpayersRespond","abstract":"We examine two Pakistani programs to see if the public disclosure of tax information and social recognition of top taxpayers promote tax compliance. Pakistan began revealing income tax paid by every taxpayer in the country from 2012. Simultaneously, another program began recognizing and rewarding the top 100 tax paying corporations, partnerships, self-employed individuals, and wage-earners. We ﬁnd that both programs induced strong compliance responses. The public disclosure caused on average a 9 log-points increase in the tax paid by individuals exposed to the program. The increase was even larger for the social recognition program, around 17 log-points. Our results suggest that such programs can be important policy levers to mobilize resources, especially in weak-enforcement-capacity economies.","author":[{"family":"Slemrod","given":"Joel"},{"family":"Rehman","given":"Obeid Ur"},{"family":"Addresses","given":"Mazhar WaseemEmail"}],"citation-key":"slemrodHowTaxpayersRespond","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"How Do Taxpayers Respond to Public Disclosure and Social Recognition Programs?

Many countries have already considered data governance and dissemination of open government data to the citizen imperative. Although Thailand has prescribed a draft of public information act, data governance for government data is still unclear. Hence, this research proposes a conceptual legal framework for open government data in data governance aspects. The results of preliminary studies from the previous research are used in this paper including gap analysis and compare results between Public Information Act of the United States of America, the Republic of Korea and the current draft of Public Information Act of Thailand. The coverage issues are on the organizational structure, organizational roles, and responsibilities of Public Information Committee. The proposed amendments is applied in the current draft of the Public Information act for Thailand. This includes defining the standardization and security on open data by taking the existing data governance framework as a guideline for determining the procedures and compliance according to the data governance framework for Thailand.","author":[{"family":"Thammaboosadee","given":"Sotarat"},{"family":"Dumthanasarn","given":"Natcha"}],"citation-key":"thammaboosadeeProposedAmendments2018","container-title":"2018 3rd Technology Innovation Management and Engineering Science International Conference (TIMES-iCON)","container-title-short":"2018 3rd Technol.

Using a consensus-based expert elicitation process, we find that AI can enable the accomplishment of 134 targets across all the goals, but it may also inhibit 59 targets. However, current research foci overlook important aspects.

  {"id":"yasudaLawDevelopmentSoutheast2002","abstract":"This chapter presents a methodological framework by proposing several sets of concepts consisting of three types of law (‘indigenous law,’ ‘imported law,’ and ‘development law’), three types of legal principles (‘community,’ ‘market,’ and ‘command’) as more operational concepts and ‘community force’ and ‘market force’ to refer to their dynamics. Next, it illustrates the historical development of Southeast Asian legal systems under the three different state concepts, the ‘proto-state,’ ‘colonial state,’ and ‘developmental state.’ The effectiveness of these concepts are tested during this process. The chapter then outlines law and development problems with regards to the aspects of political, economic and social development under the regime of the 'developmental state,' which functioned most effectively during the 1970s and early 1980s and led to rapid development in the region. Finally, it addresses why the developmental legal systems of East and Southeast Asia have been facing such a serious crisis in the closing years of the twentieth century.","author":[{"family":"Yasuda","given":"Nobuyuki"}],"citation-key":"yasudaLawDevelopmentSoutheast2002","container-title":"Law and Development in East and South-East Asia","ISBN":"978-0-203-98894-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002"]]},"number-of-pages":"43","page":"25-67","publisher":"Routledge","title":"Law and Development from the Southeast Asian Perspective: Methodology, History, and Paradigm Change","title-short":"Law and Development from the Southeast Asian Perspective","type":"chapter"},
