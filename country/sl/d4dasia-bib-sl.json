In Sri Lanka, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act of 2007 remains at the centre of this challenge. One of the principal aims of the Act is to protect persons from speech that incites violence and discrimination. This article explains how the ICCPR Act ought to be interpreted and applied. It then discusses how the Act is interpreted and applied in practice in Sri Lanka – how it has failed to fulfil its actual purpose, and has instead become a tool of repression. What is prohibited? Section 3(1) of the ICCPR Act provides: “No person shall…advocate national, racial, or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility, or violence.” This offence is not the only speech-related offence found in Sri Lanka’s law.

  {"id":"delaporteChallengesDigitisationCultural2019","abstract":"Background: Digitisation of cultural heritage material creates both opportunities and challenges for access and preservation for future generations.\nObjectives: Digital cultural heritage can be sustainably preserved and used for information and research purposes if the challenges experienced during digitisation can be identified and addressed by memory institutions.\nMethod: A quantitative approach was used to analyse challenges for digitisation identified in the literature review. The theory of constraints was used as the theoretical framework for the study. Twenty-eight memory institutions in the City of Cape Town Metropolitan and Cape Winelands District municipalities were selected with non-probability sampling and data were collected with a cross-sectional survey, using a self-administered online questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the data.\nResults: The digitisation of cultural heritage material is embraced by memory institutions and a wide variety of cultural heritage material has been selected for digitisation. Memory institutions are following professional or international guidelines, but the lack of a national policy on digitisation has possible consequences for interoperability and limited access. Open access to digitised cultural heritage material is encouraged, but access for use is still limited. The challenges identified in the literature review are experienced by the memory institutions studied, especially those relating to expertise and human resources.\nConclusion: Challenges in digitisation can be addressed with the knowledge of how to manage these constraints. International guidelines and policies can give directives to the management of digitisation if no national or local guidelines exist.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"De La Porte","given":"Beatrice"},{"family":"Higgs","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"delaporteChallengesDigitisationCultural2019","container-title":"SA Journal of Information Management","container-title-short":"SA Journal of Information Management","DOI":"10.4102/sajim.v21i1.1104","ISSN":"1560-683X, 2078-1865","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,30]]},"language":"en","note":"7 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2023-10-02]","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Challenges in digitisation of cultural heritage material in the Western Cape, South Africa","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sajim.co.za/index.php/SAJIM/article/view/1104","volume":"21"},

The findings found that there were three Laws or Acts for cybersecurity in Thailand, Singapore, and Vietnam. The laws had five outstanding differences in details as follows: policy goals, involved agencies, strata of cybersecurity threats, cybersecurity maintenance, and penalty provision. In addition, there were three issues on the implementation of cybersecurity law-balance between cybersecurity and access; controlling of data, information, and knowledge; and direct effect of a set of classical factors of public policy implementation on the success of cybersecurity policy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,17]]},"archive":"https://web.archive.org/web/20230817032545/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3546333","author":[{"family":"Gohwong","given":"Srirath Goi"}],"citation-key":"gohwongStateArtCybersecurity2019","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.3546333","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,1]]},"language":"en","number":"3546333","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"Social Science Research Network","title":"The State of the Art of Cybersecurity Law in ASEAN","type":"article","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3546333"},

  {"id":"gorianSingaporesCybersecurityAct2020","abstract":"National mechanisms of critical information infrastructure (CII) protection differ depending on the information assets, authorities’ powers, methods of regulation, etc. Singapore implements the state-driven approach for CII protection that is balanced and calibrated in order to harmonize the efficient powers of authorities with the burdens imposed on IT industry parties. Singapore’s Cybersecurity Act 2018 (CSA) establishes a solid and precise framework for the CII protection specifying three core aspects: constant cooperation of public authorities and private sector in envisaging a CII system; broad authorities for prevention, management and response to cybersecurity threats and incidents in Singapore, and compulsory licensing of cybersecurity services. It emphasizes compliance with promulgated codes of practice and expresses designation of CII and cybersecurity threats. The distinctive feature of the act is its significant reduction of the compliance burden on cybersecurity professionals and CII owners. As for the CII protection it’s important that computer systems in the supply chain supporting the operation of a CII (i.e. data centre owners and cloud services operators) will not be designated as CIIs. Thus the CSA illustrates the narrow approach of law makers in envisaging its jurisdiction – it implies just CII owners and not any network operators. Singapore is a first jurisdiction in South-East region that has developed its cybersecurity legislation to impose requirements on certain businesses to implement protections against cybersecurity risks into their computer systems.","author":[{"family":"Gorian","given":"E."}],"citation-key":"gorianSingaporesCybersecurityAct2020","collection-title":"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies","container-title":"Smart Technologies and Innovations in Design for Control of Technological Processes and Objects: Economy and Production","container-title-short":"Smart Technol.

  {"id":"gunatillekeLimitationsFundamentalFreedoms2023","abstract":"Sri Lanka’s Constitution authorises the state to limit certain fundamental freedoms on the grounds of specific public interests. This article examines how this constitutional limitation regime has become vulnerable to majoritarian influence. It uses a case study approach, supplemented by key informant interviews, to delve into Sri Lanka’s constitutional practice with respect to limitations on fundamental freedoms such as the freedom of religion or belief, and the freedom of expression. The article illustrates how organs of the Sri Lankan state have equated notions of ‘public interest’ with the majority community’s conceptions of ‘security’, ‘order’, ‘health’ and ‘morals’. It argues that this practice reflects a cleavage between the moral legitimacy and the legal claimability of fundamental freedoms of minorities and satirists in Sri Lanka. It concludes that legal regimes designed to guarantee fundamental freedoms offer very little protection to minorities when the underlying politics driving the application of law is majoritarian.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Gunatilleke","given":"Gehan"}],"citation-key":"gunatillekeLimitationsFundamentalFreedoms2023","container-title":"International Journal of Law in Context","container-title-short":"International Journal of Law in Context","DOI":"10.1017/S1744552323000113","ISSN":"1744-5523, 1744-5531","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9]]},"language":"en","note":"0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2023-11-21]","page":"334–351","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Limitations on fundamental freedoms in Sri Lanka: majoritarian influence of constitutional practice","title-short":"Limitations on fundamental freedoms in Sri Lanka","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S1744552323000113/type/journal_article","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"paulosChallengesRegulatingHate2021","abstract":"Despite the fact that international human rights documents stipulate that everyone has the right to freedom of thought and expression, many nations nowadays have laws that restrict or ban some forms of social media expression, such as speech that provokes hatred and violence. Some free speech advocates prefer an open market of ideas where no expression is restricted thinking that the best answer to harmful speech is discussions that allow different ideas to challenge any speech freely. Other scholars, on the other hand, contend that regulating hate speech on social media is crucial for protecting minority populations from the damages that such speech can inflict. Hate speech poses a difficult question that blurs the lines of free expression. Thus, based on the theories that underpin freedom of expression, this piece of work strives to analyze the regulatory dilemma on hate speech on social media by exploring the arguments and challenges that frame the regulatory process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Paulos","given":"Biruk"},{"family":"Çeli̇K","given":"Seydi"}],"citation-key":"paulosChallengesRegulatingHate2021","container-title":"Süleyman Demirel Üniversitesi Hukuk Fakültesi Dergisi","container-title-short":"Süleyman Demirel Üniversitesi Hukuk Fakültesi Derg.","DOI":"10.52273/sduhfd..922588","ISSN":"2146-7129","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,30]]},"language":"en","page":"97–134","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The challenges of regulating hate speech on social media in light of the theory of freedom of expression","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dergipark.org.tr/en/doi/10.52273/sduhfd..922588","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"prasetyoTrajectoryDemocracySri2022","abstract":"COVID-19 pandemic has heavily influenced the legal conduct of a state, especially Sri Lanka. This country is one of the so-called democratic states shown to abuse law conduct under the backdrop of emergency measures, so many people have been detained due to newly enacted policies. Since the beginning of this pandemic, various criticism of pandemic management has addressed the state-triggered government overreaches such as arrestable offenses and internet censorship in the name of public order. This research aims to analyze whether the government's responses to opinions, critics, or any media format that embodies a form of speech are justified as an emergency measure against COVID-19. Then, this paper analyzes further its implication for freedom of speech. In addition, this research aims to challenge the government's measurement of the limitation of freedom of expression in social media. This research analyzes the government's response to securing fundamental rights during emergency regulations. In addition, the Sri Lankan legal framework of previous judicial precedent and state conduct towards the issue will be further analyzed. In addition, various rules from the authoritarian and democratic states compared further understand the framework on freedom of expression. This study showed a declining democratic value in Sri Lanka. Different legal conducts indicated that the Sri Lankan government does not comply with the rule of law and the fundamental rights of its citizen. This study emphasizes the need for immediate legal reform, especially in various mishandled cases. State oppression of freedom of expression harms the public order and threatens state stability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Prasetyo","given":"Anggi"},{"family":"Prabhata","given":"Evoryo Carel"}],"citation-key":"prasetyoTrajectoryDemocracySri2022","container-title":"Jurnal Kajian Pembaruan Hukum","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"rajapakseSriLankasNew2023","abstract":"A new Draft Bill on Online Safety was recently published in the Gazette of 15th September (issued on 19th September).  As stated, the objectives of the Bill are to ‘to establish an online Safety Commission; to make provisions to prohibit online communication of certain statements of fact in Sri Lanka; prevent the use of online accounts and inauthentic online accounts for prohibited purposes; make provisions to identify and declare online locations used for prohibited purposes in Sri Lanka; and to suppress the financing and other support of communication of false statements of fact.’ Many provisions of the new Bill appear to be modelled on Singapore’s Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA). However, there are significant differences.  In the following sections we highlight some of the differences, based on an initial reading of the two documents. This is not an analysis of how either law will be interpreted and enforced (in the case of Sri Lanka) or is being interpreted and enforced (in the case of Singapore). The Sinhala translation of this analysis can be found here. We also point out instances where the law maybe duplicating actions that can already be handled under other existing laws.
